# mini-tank-by-raspberry-pi
The tank is built up of a gun which could change it's angle in about 60 degrees in different dimensions and is controlled by raspberry pie 5. The four wheels are Mecanum wheel so they can move in horizontal directions. A web page and it's server is built on raspberry pie to control it under the same wifi.

## Overview

This project is a remote-controlled rover built with a **Raspberry Pi 5**. It features four **Mecanum wheels** that allow for omnidirectional movement, including horizontal strafing. The rover is equipped with a water cannon mounted on a 2-axis gimbal, allowing its angle to be adjusted up to 60 degrees for precise aiming.

Control is handled via a self-hosted web interface, allowing any device on the same Wi-Fi network to operate the rover through a browser.

* **Web-Based Control**: A responsive web interface hosted on the Raspberry Pi for intuitive control from a phone or computer.
* **Real-time Commands**: Low-latency control over Wi-Fi.
* **Powered by Raspberry Pi 5**: Leverages the performance of the latest Raspberry Pi for smooth operation.

**Top Layer:** Contains the gimbal in the center, the gun mounted on top of it, a laser emitter at the gun's muzzle, an LED at the base of the gun barrel, and the camera positioned in front of the (fake) scope.

**Middle Layer:** Houses the L298N motor driver in the front, a power bank on the left rear, and the Raspberry Pi on the right rear.

**Bottom Layer:** Contains the large battery for powering the motors and the gun mechanism, located at the front of the chassis. A small relay is positioned slightly behind the battery.

**Note:** This is a highly simplified representation and does not show the exact placement or connections of all components.


## üíª Software & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm or newer) flashed onto a MicroSD card.
* Python 3.11+
* Git
* Visual Studio Code (highly recommended)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment on your Raspberry Pi.

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    First, download the project files from GitHub to your Raspberry Pi and navigate into the newly created directory.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/frankluyf/mini-tank-by-raspberry-pi.git
    cd mini-tank-by-raspberry-pi
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

    Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to keep project dependencies isolated from the system's global Python packages.

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment named "tank_venv"
    cd tank
    # Recommend to install the environment in tank 
    python3 -m venv tank_venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    source tank_venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *(You'll know it's active when you see `(tank_venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.)*

3.  **Install Required Libraries**

    With the virtual environment active, install all the necessary Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Wi-Fi**

    Ensure your Raspberry Pi is connected to the same Wi-Fi network that you will use to control the vehicle.

After these steps, the software environment is fully configured and ready to run.

### Power System

| Source / Junction Point | Destination & Connection | Function / Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| L298N `GND` | -> Raspberry Pi `GND` (e.g., Pin 9)<br>-> Relay `NC`<br>-> Battery `Negative (-)` | **System Main Ground Junction.** All grounds are tied together at this point. |
| L298N `VCC` (+12V) | -> Relay `NO`<br>-> Battery `Positive (+)` | **System Main Power Junction.** All positive leads are tied together at this point. |
| Relay `COM` | -> "Gun" Module `Negative (-)` | **Switched Output.** Controlled by the relay. |
| Relay `NC` | -> "Gun" Module `Positive (+)`<br>   *(Also connected to Ground)* | **Default Output.** Connected to ground by default. |


> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Wiring Warning**
> **Please double-check your circuit diagram and logic before applying power to prevent potential damage to your components.** Standard practice is typically to use a relay to switch a single positive (+) power line.
